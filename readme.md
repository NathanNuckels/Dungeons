#Welcome to Dungeons

This is a basic text based RPG I am working on. I will write in in python and then slowly port it
to C# Over time

###Running

You should be able to just download it and open launch.py

###Install from CLI

Make sure you have python installed.

Start by going to an empty folder and running this:

```bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/NathanNuckels/(REPO NAME)
git pull origin master
```

Run the code with

    python launch.py


Note: I dont spell werds and I write this in notepad so...
